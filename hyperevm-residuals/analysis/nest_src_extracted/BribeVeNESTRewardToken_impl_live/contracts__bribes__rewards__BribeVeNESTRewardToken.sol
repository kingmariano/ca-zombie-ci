 * the conversion of NEST rewards into veNEST NFTs via a VotingEscrow contract. Users can
 * receive these intermediary tokens (brVeNEST) when they deposit NEST. When these tokens
 * are transferred to non-whitelisted addresses, they are automatically burned and
 * converted into veNEST NFTs by locking NEST in the VotingEscrow contract. This flow is
 * particularly useful for "bribe" mechanisms, where veNEST positions are desired like bribes
 * without directly managing lock creation and extension.
