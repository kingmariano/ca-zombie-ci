/// @notice Library for managing aggregate funding tracking across positions
/// @dev This library enables O(symbols) funding debt calculation instead of O(quotes)
///      by maintaining aggregate funding state that is updated incrementally
///
/// The key insight is that for quotes sharing the same (partyA, partyB, symbolId, positionType):
///
/// Total Funding = Σ [openAmount_i × (currentFee - accumulatedPaidFunding_i)] / 1e18
///               = currentFee × Σ(openAmount_i) / 1e18 - Σ(openAmount_i × accumulatedPaidFunding_i) / 1e18
///               = currentFee × totalOpenAmount / 1e18 - totalWeightedPaidFunding / 1e18
///
/// By tracking totalWeightedPaidFunding = Σ(openAmount × accumulatedPaidFunding), we can
/// calculate total funding debt without iterating through all quotes.
