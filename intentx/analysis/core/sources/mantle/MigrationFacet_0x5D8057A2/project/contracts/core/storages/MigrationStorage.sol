///      1. Cross Mode - Unified PartyB locked/pending locked balance tracking via address(0) bucket
///      2. Aggregated Positions - O(symbols) UPNL/funding calculations instead of O(quotes)
///
///      Migration is performed via MigrationFacet with MIGRATION_ROLE:
///      - migrateQuotes(): Backfills aggregated positions/funding and other derived state for existing open positions
///      - migrateCrossLockedValues(): Sums per-PartyA locked/pending locked balances into cross bucket
